# TET
March 2017. Created using XCode 8.1 and Swift 3.0. This is an iOS app compatible for iPhone 5,6,6+, and 7.
This app saves users expenses into a log table. Each expense has a date, category, amount, title, and comment. After adding an expense, the expense gets added to the log, which can be sorted based on date, amount, or category. Users are able to delete and edit expenses and also click to view more details. After ending a trip, the trip gets added to a log of past trips. Users are able to view these past trips and also edit and delete them. There is also an option to make the past trip the current trip.
